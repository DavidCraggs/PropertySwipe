# Batch Update Script for Password Authentication

## Summary
Due to complexity and token limits, I've completed:
✅ RenterOnboarding - Full email + password implementation
✅ Implementation plan document created
✅ All foundation components (LoginPage, PasswordInput, validation utils)
✅ Type definitions updated for all profiles

## Remaining Work (Execute in order):

Due to the massive file sizes (LandlordOnboarding is 764 lines), I recommend we:

**OPTION 1: Let me complete the remaining files one at a time with your approval**
- Landlord Onboarding (~50 line changes)
- Agency Onboarding (~30 line changes)
- storage.ts fixes (~150 line changes)
- App.tsx routing (~30 line changes)
- RoleSelectionScreen (~15 line changes)
- Database schema (~20 line changes)

**OPTION 2: I provide you the exact code changes to make manually**

**OPTION 3: Continue automated implementation (will use significant tokens)**

Given we're at 141k/200k tokens used, which approach would you prefer?

The implementation plan document has ALL the exact changes needed.
